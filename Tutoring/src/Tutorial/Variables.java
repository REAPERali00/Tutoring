		 * what that means, is instead of the actuall variable, there is an id. id is basically the location 
		 * of the actual object.
		 * why? well, primitive types are small, and have a determined size. imagine them as a small box, 
		 * easy to move around. reference types (or objects, classes, instances, so on) are like a massive heavy box. 
		 * we don't want to move them around as they are big and heavy, we can but its taxing. 
		 * so instead we will just tell people where the box is(ie the address, or id) and they can go grab 
		 * whatever they want from the box. 
		 * now thats enough theory, lets get to the nitty gritty stuff!

		//but, what are we supposed to put on the right side? 
		reference = new Refs(); //well, the right hand side is new ClassName(), this is the constructor which we will learn later. 
		//alright, we now made the reference instance, or object of type Refs. now how do I use my stuff in it? 
		//simple, just say the var name follwed by a . 
		reference.num = 2; //Like this! 
		//System.out.println(reference.num); //and this prints num inside reference! 
		
		Refs reference2 = new Refs(); //now, lets make a second one! 
//		System.out.println(reference2.num); //what will this print? 2? 
		//lets get weirder. 
//		System.out.println(new Refs().num); //what will this do?!  
		
		new Refs().num = 2;
